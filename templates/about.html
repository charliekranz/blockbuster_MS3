The Block+Buster+Builder Building Blocks have been created from plot summaries of some of the biggest and best movies of all time. In creating these Story Building Blocks, I tried to find unique descriptions of each set of stories characters, plots, resolutions and settings. I also tried to select a variety of film types to so that the story combinations might be as unique as possible.</h5>
