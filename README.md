## Design

- ### Branding 
    - The Block+Buster+Builder brand is an alliterative phrasing that has the dual purpose of evoking succesful films (Blockbusters) as well as the compartmentalized "block" construction which makes up the experience.
    - Clear iconography for all features and functions
    - Further "B" alliteration with the Build and Browse features

- ### Colours
    - Using a very simple, though unusual, Purple schematic
    - Additional colour variations to highlight functions: Delete (red) and Cancel (Gray)

- ### UI
    - Clean, simple UI
    - Larger screens allow for some 2 column layouts
    - Smaller screens use 1-column layout throughout and some font-size reduction

- #### Typography
    - Poppins font for bolder, larger text
    - Open Sans for body and smaller text
    - Sans Serif as the fallback

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Paginate ?
- Heroku delay on register for iOS?
- re-index db to include username and update text on search 
- re-populate the BBs with proper data
- validate / readme and screengrabs, etc


## Technologies used


mongoDB
heroku
materialise
jquery
fontawesome
werkzeug

using hover (akragas)
popper and slim min
fancybox


## Code used

RandomKeygen for random [https://randomkeygen.com/]
getlist fix partial https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53344797/how-create-an-array-with-checkboxes-in-flask



## Testing 

- Accordion on blockbusters page were initially unable to target stories properly. Titles with spaces and/or a number at the start of title_name caused issues. Fixed by using ObjectId instead and adding a character to the start (BB).

- The selected casts weren't appearing as selected in the edit template. Using cast-checkbox class on edit template so that the selected cast appear chosen (thanks to Ronan for spotting that in particular)

- Edit template Updates were not sending cast selection changes. Changed Edit App Route from "cast_members": request.form.getlist("cast_members") to "cast_members": cast_members as request.form did not apply in tghis case. (Thanks to Ronan for spotting this)
- Caught missing else condition in edit_story.html which as preventing the Genre selection from properly displaying on edit.


In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so itâ€™s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used â€˜image1.pngâ€™ consider naming it â€˜landing_page_img.pngâ€™. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
